# <p align="center"> Homework: Methods <p>

This document defines the homework assignments from the [&quot;Advanced C#&quot; Course @ Software University](http://softuni.bg/courses/advanced-csharp/). Please submit as homework a single **zip** / **rar** / **7z** archive holding the solutions (source code) of all below described problems.

### Problem 1. Bigger Number

Write a method **GetMax()** with two parameters that returns the larger of two integers. Write a program that reads 2 integers from the console and prints the largest of them using the method **GetMax()**.

###  Problem 2. Last Digit of Number

Write a method that returns the last digit of a given integer as an English word. Test the method with different input values. Ensure you name the method properly.

### Problem 3. Larger Than Neighbours

Write a method that checks if the element at given position in a given array of integers is larger than its two **neighbours** (when such exist).

### Problem 4. First Larger Than Neighbours

Write a method that returns the index of the **first element in array** that is **larger** than its **neighbours** , or **-1** if there&#39;s no such element. Use the method from the previous exercise in order to re.

### Problem 5. Reverse Number

Write a method that **reverses the digits** of a given **floating-point** number.

### Problem 6. Number Calculations

Write methods to calculate the **minimum** , **maximum** , **average** , **sum** and **product** of a given set of numbers. **Overload** the methods to work with numbers of type **double** and **decimal**.

**Note** :Do not use LINQ.

### Problem 7. \* Generic Array Sort

Write a method which takes an array of any type and sorts it. Use **bubble sort** or **selection sort** ( **your own implementation** ). You may re-use your code from a previous homework and modify it.

Use a **generic method** (read in Internet about **generic methods in C#** ). Make sure that what you&#39;re trying to sort can be sorted â€“ your method should work with **numbers** , **strings** , **dates** , etc., but not necessarily with custom classes like Student.
